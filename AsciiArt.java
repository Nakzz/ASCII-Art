public class AsciiArt {


  // You are free to organize your solution to the best of your ability, using whatever combination of
  // fields and methods seems best to you. Running the main method in this class must result in an
  // interactive session like the one demonstrated above. Here are some specific requirements for how
  // this interactive session should proceed:
  //
  // Launching the AsciiArt class’s main method should immediately begin a driver loop and present the
  // user with a menu similar to the one at the top of this writeup.
  // From the user’s perspective, the top left corner of the Canvas is located at row 0, column 0.
  // When prompting the user for drawing coordinates, ask for the row and then the column on separate
  // lines. We recommend using Scanner.nextLine() for user input.
  // The menu should be stable. Bad user input should result in a message indicating the bad input and
  // should prompt the user again. You may choose what message to print, but make it descriptive! You
  // may meet this requirement using any combination of careful coding and try/catch blocks. However,
  // you may not catch Exception or RuntimeException. If you catch an exception, you must catch the
  // specific exception class(es) that you expect to occur, and you must catch them at the specific
  // place you expect them to occur. (Do not wrap a try block around your entire driver loop.)
  // Entering drawing coordinates should also be stable. Your Canvas.draw() method throws an
  // IllegalArgumentException if given coordinates outside the drawing area. Your driver should avoid
  // causing this exception. You may either avoid it with careful coding or handle it with try/catch.
  //
