// The DrawingStackIterator you create must implement Iterator<DrawingChange> and must be a direct
// iterator over your stack. Its constructor should take a Node<DrawingChange> as a parameter, and
// your DrawingStackâ€™s iterator() method should return a new DrawingStackIterator that starts at the
// top of the stack of DrawingChanges.
